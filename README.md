# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a new game button to reset the board for a fresh round of play.

## Motivation

This project was created as a learning exercise in web development and building logic for deploying websites. Developing a game like Tic Tac Toe helped me understand key concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic implementation.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features

- Multiplayer functionality allows two players to take turns marking spaces on the board.
- New game button resets the board for a new round.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## How to Play

1. Open the  index.html file in your web browser.
2. Two players take turns clicking on empty squares to mark them with either 'X' or 'O'.
3. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all squares are filled without any player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

## Future Improvements

- Implementing an AI opponent for single-player mode.
- Adding animations and sound effects for a more engaging user experience.
- Enhancing the UI with customizable themes and player avatars.
